# Data Science Wage Prediction 2020 (During Crisis)

* Developed a tool that estimates Data Scientists wages (MAE ~ $ 11K) to serve as a wage comparator when negotiating the pay.
* Used Selenium and Chromdriver to scraped over 1000 job descriptions on from Glassdoor.
* Quantified technical requirements from skills requirements and emphasize placed on Python, Excel, AES & Spark. 
* Tested the mode on Lasso, Random forest, Linear regression using GridsearchCV to find the best fit  
* Developed front end API using flask
